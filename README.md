Homework 18 - Fitness Tracker

## Description

This project helps to record different workouts done by an individual. The user is able to add either a cardio or a resistance exercise. For a cardio exercise, they can record the activity done, the miles they went and how long it took. For a resistance exercise, they are able to track the activity, weight, reps, and duration. If the user looks at their dashboard they see a chart that shows the amount of time they have worked out during a span of time. There is another chart that shows the amount of weight per day they worked out.
